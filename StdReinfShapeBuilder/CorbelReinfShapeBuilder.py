    """Create a 3-dimensional rebar shape for the column corbel. The created shape has 5 legs in total.
    The corbel is assumed to be at the right side of the columns rectangular cross-section.
    The shape's legs are created in following directions: Z+, X+, Y+, X-, Z-.
    This means, that from above the generated shape will look like Ↄ

    In addition, following assumptions are made:

    -   First and last legs (the vertical ones, parallel to Z axis) are 1m long
    -   Bending roller is the same for all legs
    -   Cross section of the column is a rectangle
    -   Corbel Y-dimension is the same as the Y-dimension of the column's cross section
    -   All concrete covers are assumed to be identical

    Args:
        column_width:        Width (X-dimension) of the column's cross-section
        column_thickness:    Thickness (Y-dimension) of the column's cross-section
        corbel_width:        Corbel width (X-dimension)
        corbel_top:          Elevation (Z-coordinate) of the corbel's top surface
        model_angles:        Angles to rotate the shape from local to global coordinate system.
        shape_props:         Shape properties
        concrete_cover:      Concrete cover at the shape sides
